# Playing with Ruby and Ruby on Rails

This is my version of a Job Board called Ki-Jobs developed using Ruby and Runy on Rails.

I also deployed this app to Heroku, for easy access.

## Gems

- Simple form: Create easy forms.
- Will Paginate: Paginate pages.
- Devise: Add recruiters, users and also registrations and session pages(Sign up, Log in and Edit account pages).
